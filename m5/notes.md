#Some notes I'm keeping from this fifth module:

Within this module there is a single index.html file that calls the javascript code from the js directory. *Also added a file called HTMLPage.html that will display results of the javascript processing rather than using the alert function.* It is setup to always call the file named script.js and after each snippet of video tutorial we copy that file content to a another js file representative of the constructs discussed. So, from the script.js file we create the following files in order:


1. return.js
1. functionScopes.js
