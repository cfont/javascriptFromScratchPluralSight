JavaScript From Scratch --> PluralSight
================================

Exercise files repo for the 'JavaScript from Scratch' course on PluralSight 

The video course can be found at --> http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/javascript-from-scratch <-- and includes a transcript, exercise files, and some discussion. 

I will create directories for at least each module to keep track of the files created, modified, and otherwise used for the course. Because I haven't been a full time web developer for many years I'm mostly hoping to renew my knowledge of javascript, pick up on basic nuances that I may have never learned previously, and pique my interest in a hobby that I used to love.
