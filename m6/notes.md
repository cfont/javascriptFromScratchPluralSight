#Some notes I'm keeping from this sixth module:

Within this module there is a single index.html file that calls the javascript code from the js directory. It is setup to always call the file named script.js and after each snippet of video tutorial we copy that file content to a another js file representative of the constructs discussed.


* arrays are the only collection class in javascript. a special object type.
* regardless of using single or double quotes for strings the other type can be used within the quotes without causing a problem.
* you can also escape the quotes using "\".



So, from the script.js file we create the following files in order:


1. object.js
1. arrays.js
1. pushPopArrays.js
